**xk6-plugin** `v0.1.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

**Create k6 plugins using JavaScript and Node.js**

The **xk6-plugin** k6 extension makes the Node.js runtime available to k6 tests using k6 plugins. Plugins are executed by a modern Node.js compatible runtime ([Deno](https://deno.com) or [Bun](https://bun.sh)), so they can use the entire Node.js ecosystem.

In simple terms, a plugin is nothing more than a JavaScript (or TypeScript) module executed on the Node.js runtime, whose exported functions are available from k6 tests. Both [Deno](https://deno.com) and [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtimes are supported.

## Features

- the entire Node.js ecosystem is available, millions of packages
- plugins can be written in TypeScript/JavaScript
- modern Node.js compatible JavaScript runtime (Deno or Bun)
- no go language skills required
- plugin development does not require a custom k6 build
- plugins are ESM modules, no need to learn a new API
- plugins can be tested without k6
- k6 tests and plugins can be written in the same language

## Quick start

1. Download the archive from the [Releases page](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-plugin/releases) for your operating system and extract the `k6` executable from it.

2. Download and install [Deno](https://deno.com) and/or [Bun](https://bun.sh).

3. Create a plugin, let's say `hello.plugin.js`:

   ```js file=hello.plugin.js
   export function hello() {
    return "Hello, World!"
   }
   ```

4. Create a k6 test script that uses this plugin, let's say `script.js`:

   ```js file=script.js
   import { hello } from "k6/x/plugin/./hello.plugin.js"

   export default async function() {
    console.log(await hello())
   }
   ```

5. Run the k6 test script:

   ```bash
   k6 run -q --no-summary script.js
   ```

   You will get something like this output:

   ```
   INFO[0000] deno 2.2.2 started with ./hello.plugin.js    
   INFO[0000] Hello, World!                                 source=console
   ```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have created and used your first k6 plugin!
